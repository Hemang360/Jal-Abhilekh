Overview

SecureField is a mobile application designed to modernize river and reservoir water level monitoring. The app leverages GPS, geofencing, image capture, and cloud integration to replace manual data entry with a secure, scalable, and technologically advanced solution. This ensures accurate, real-time monitoring for flood forecasting, disaster preparedness, and resource management.

Problem Statement

In India, water level monitoring is critical for flood forecasting and water resource management. However, many readings are still taken manually at Central Water Commission (CWC) monitoring sites. Manual reporting is prone to errors, delays, and data tampering.

Challenges include:
Unauthorized or skipped readings
Lack of real-time access to water levels
Manual data entry errors
Inconsistent traceability and auditability

Solution
SecureField provides a GPS-aware, mobile-first solution that:
Validates user location with geofencing
Requires real-time photo capture of gauge posts
Automatically records timestamp, GPS coordinates, and site ID
Allows manual entry or automatic reading from images
Supports role-based access for field staff, supervisors, and administrators
Integrates with a cloud dashboard for central monitoring
Works offline with local storage, syncing automatically when internet is available

Features
Login & Role Management
Roles: Field Staff, Supervisor, Admin
Offline mode for remote areas
Biometric login support
Data Capture
Live photo capture of gauge posts
Manual entry or scanning of water level readings
QR code verification at sites for authenticity
Location & Security
GPS-based geofencing
Alerts if outside the allowed zone
Tamper detection for skipped or unauthorized readings
Data Management & Dashboard
Real-time sync with central server
Role-based dashboards for supervisors and analysts
Historical data analysis and reporting

Technology Stack
Component	Technology
Mobile App	Android, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin
Backend	Firebase / Node.js (for cloud sync)
Database	Firebase Firestore / SQL
Geolocation	Google Maps API / Location Services
Image Processing	OpenCV / ML Kit (optional for automated gauge reading)
Authentication	Firebase Auth / Biometric API


Screens / UI Flow
Login Screen – Email, Password, Role, Offline Mode
Dashboard – List of monitoring sites, real-time water levels
Capture Reading Screen – Live photo, manual entry, QR verification
Map View – Locations of all monitoring sites, geofencing alerts
Reports / Analytics – Historical data, charts, flood prediction insights
Settings – User profile, app settings, data sync controls

How It Works:
Field staff logs in and selects their role.
They navigate to a monitoring site. The app validates location using geofencing.
Staff captures a photo of the gauge post and optionally enters the reading manually.
Data is tagged with timestamp, GPS coordinates, and site ID and stored locally if offline.
Once online, the app syncs data to the cloud for real-time access.
Supervisors and analysts can view all readings on a dashboard, generate reports, and detect anomalies.

Future Enhancements
AI-based water level reading directly from gauge images
Flood prediction model using historical water level data
Push notifications for abnormal water levels
Integration with IoT sensors for automated water monitoring
