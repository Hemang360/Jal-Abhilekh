# Jal Abhilekh
‚ö° Overview

Jal Abhilekh is a mobile application designed to modernize river and reservoir water level monitoring.
The app leverages GPS, geofencing, image capture, and cloud integration to replace manual data entry with a secure, scalable, and technologically advanced solution.<br>
This ensures accurate, real-time monitoring for:<br>
Flood forecasting<br>
Disaster preparedness<br>
Water resource management<br>

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

In India, water level monitoring is critical for flood forecasting and water resource management.
However, many readings are still taken manually at Central Water Commission (CWC) monitoring sites.
Manual reporting is prone to errors, delays, and data tampering.

Challenges: <br>
Unauthorized or skipped readings<br>
Lack of real-time access to water levels<br>
Manual data entry errors<br>
Inconsistent traceability and auditability<br>

# üí° Solution

Jal Abhilekh provides a GPS-aware, mobile-first solution that:<br>
Validates user location with geofencing<br>
Requires real-time photo capture of gauge posts<br>
Automatically records timestamp, GPS coordinates, and site ID<br>
Allows manual entry or automatic reading from images<br>
Supports role-based access for field staff, supervisors, and administrators<br>
Integrates with a cloud dashboard for central monitoring<br>
Works offline with local storage, syncing automatically when the internet is available<br>

# How It Works:<br>
Field staff logs in and selects their role.<br>
They navigate to a monitoring site. The app validates location using geofencing.<br>
Staff captures a photo of the gauge post and optionally enters the reading manually.<br>
Data is tagged with timestamp, GPS coordinates, and site ID and stored locally if offline.<br>
Once online, the app syncs data to the cloud for real-time access.<br>
Supervisors and analysts can view all readings on a dashboard, generate reports, and detect anomalies.<br>
<br>
Future Enhancements<br>
AI-based water level reading directly from gauge images<br>
Flood prediction model using historical water level data<br>
Push notifications for abnormal water levels<br>
Integration with IoT sensors for automated water monitoring<br>
